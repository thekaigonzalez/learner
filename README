learner - a simple algorithm which can guess a correct answer from a given input

how it works:

        There are a list of answers and the learner guesses one of the answers,
        if the answer is RIGHT, it adds that answer to the list of right
        answers. If the answer is WRONG, it adds that answer to the list of
        wrong answers. simple enough. This algorithm in essence will remember
        each right and wrong answer and will use previous failures to influence
        the next answer.

        this algorithm embodiess principles of learning from previous
        successes and failures to increase its chances of making accurate
        predictions.
